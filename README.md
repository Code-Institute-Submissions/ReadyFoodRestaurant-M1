Ready food is an online restaurant whose aim is to attract food lovers and single Adults that love to eat out or order in and do not have time to cook. 
The site provides easy access to a variety of dishes and also enables first time or revisiting customers to become members by siging up.

## User Experience

Ready food provides a user friendly and an intuituve user experience, with only four major navigations `Home, Reviews, Dishes and signIn/SignUp`,
all of which can be accessed from the header on any page on the site.

The user on visit to Ready food is at first glance presented with a mouth watering background, an offer for second visitors and an action button
that says Food Menu, which take our users to the food menu page on first click to start making their orders right away. Ready food delivers food to the door
